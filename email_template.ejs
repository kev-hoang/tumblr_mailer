  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying
    my time.

  <p>
    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.
    Check out my new posts here:
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>
      <% } %>
  </p>
  <p>
    Talk soon,<br>
    Kevin
